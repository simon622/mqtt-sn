/**
 * A context factory deals with the initial construction of the context objects which identity
 * the remote connection to the application. There are 2 types of context; a {@link NetworkContext}
 * and a {@link ClientIdentifierContext}. The network context identifies where (the network location) the identity
 * resides and the mqttsn-context identifies who the context is (generally this is the CliendId or GatewayId of
 * the connected resource).
 *
 * A {@link NetworkContext} can exist in isolation without an associated {@link ClientIdentifierContext}, during a CONNECT attempt
 *  (when the context has yet to be established), or during a failed CONNECTion. An application context cannot exist without
 * a network context.
 *
 * You can provide your own implementation, if you wish to wrap or provide your own extending context implementation
 * to wrap custom User objects, for example.
